ENVIRONMENTAL FATE

diclofop-methyl

Animals When fed to rats, diclofop-methyl is almost totally absorbed and then rapidly
excreted . . . . Plants Diclofop-methyl is taken up rapidly and almost completely by plants.
Translocation . . . . Soil and water In soil, diclofop-methyl is metabolised to diclofop, which
then undergoes further degradation to . . . .
