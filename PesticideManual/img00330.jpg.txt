ENVIRONMENTAL FATE

Animals Major pathways in animal metabolism are hydrolysis of the methylthio group to
form the hydroxy derivative, sulfoxidation of the methylthio group, and side-chain
dealkylation. Plants Major pathways in plant metabolism are the hydrolysis of the
methylthio group to form the hydroxy derivative, conjugation with glutathione and side-
chain dealkylation. Soil and water Degradation involves oxidation of the methylthio
group to sulfoxide and sulfone, hydrolysis with the introduction of a 2-hydroxy group,
dealkylation at the substituted amino groups, cleavage of the amine moiety, and ring
opening. Duration of residual activity in soil is c. 3 months. KO, 150.
