ENVIRONMENTAL FATE

Animals The principal metabolites are diethyl thiophosphate and diethyl phosphate.
Plants Studies with "C-labelled diazinon show a rapid absorption and translocation in
plants. Metabolism proceeds via hydrolysis and subsequent transformation and
degradation of the hydroxypyrimidine derivatives to carbon dioxide.

Soil and water Degradation involves oxidation to the phosphate (diazoxon) and
hydrolysis (J . Pardue et al., J. Agric. Food Chem. 1970, 18, 405-408). DT50 c. 11-21 d
(laboratory). Diazinon is fairly strongly adsorbed onto soil, KOM 332 mg/ g o.m. Mobility
is low.
