ECOTOXICOLOGY

dicamba

Birds Acute oral LD5o for mallard ducks 2000 mg/ kg. Eight-day dietary LC5o for mallard
ducks and bobwhite quail > 10000 mg/kg diet. Fish LCSO (96 h) for rainbow trout and
bluegill sunﬁsh 135 mg/1. Bees Not toxic to bees. Daphnia EC” (48 h) 110 mg/l.

ENVIRONMENTAL FATE

Animals In mammals, following oral administration, dicamba is rapidly eliminated in the
urine, partly as a glycine conjugate. Plants The degradation rate in plants varies greatly
with species. In wheat, the major metabolite is 5-hydroxy-2~methoxy-3,6-dichlorobcnzoic
acid, whilst 3,6—dichlorosalicylic acid is also a metabolite. Soil and water In soil,
microbial degradation occurs, the principal metabolite being 3,6—dichlorosalicylic acid.
Under conditions amenable to rapid metabolism, DT50 < 14 d. K0, = 2.
