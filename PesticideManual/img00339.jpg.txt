insecticides and with alkaline compounds. Should not be mixed with wetting agents or
adhesives. Principal tradename ‘Euparen’ (Bayer). Mixtures [dichloﬂuanid +] oxadixyl;

ANALYSIS _ _ _
Product analysis by hplc (CIPAC Handbook, 1985, IC, 2083) or by reaction with sodium

methoxide and, ultimately, titration of the chloride (ibid., 1983, 1B, 1774). Residues
determined by glc (Man. Pestic. Residue Anal., 1987, I; R. Brennecke, Pﬂanzenschutz-
Nachr. Bayer (Engl. Ed), 1988, 41, 137; 1989, 42, 223; A. Ambrus et al., J. Assoc. Off
Anal. Chem., 1981, 64, 733). Details of methods available from Bayer AG.

ENVIRONMENTAL FATE

Animals In rats, following oral administration, dichloﬂuanid is rapidly absorbed and
excreted, mainly in the urine, with a small proportion in the faeces and via respiration.
There is no accumulation in organs and tissues. Dichloﬂuanid is metabolised to
dimethylsulfanilide which is further hydroxylated and/ or demethylated. Plants In plants,
dichloﬂuanid is metabolised to dimethylsulfanilide which is further demethylated and/ or
hydroxylated and conjugated. Soil and water Due to its instability in soil, dichloﬂuanid
is not leached into deeper soil layers. The main metabolite (dimetliylsulfanilide) is further

degraded and, according to parent and aged leaching studies, is unlikely to leach into
deeper soil layers.
