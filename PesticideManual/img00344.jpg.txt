COMMERCIALISATION

History Properties as a soil fumigant reported by Dow Chemical Co. (Down Earth, 1956,
12(2), 7), who introduced it. Manufacturer DowElanco.

APPLICATIONS

Mode of action Soil fumigant nematicide. Uses Pre-planting control of most species of
nematode in deciduous fruit and nuts, citrus fruit, berry fruit, vines, strawberries, hops,
ﬁeld crops, vegetables, tobacco, beet, pineapples, peanuts, ornamental and ﬂower crops,
tree nurseries, etc. Also has secondary insecticidal (soil insects) and fungicidal activity,
and, by controlling nematode virus vectors, control is obtained of virus diseases of
strawberries, raspberries, tomatoes, hops, etc. Phytotoxicity Phytotoxic, and should
therefore not be applied near desired plants. Formulation type Liquid.

Compatibility Compatible with 1,2-dichloropropane (forming the mixture D-D).
Principal tradename ‘Telone’ (DowElanco), ‘D-D92’ (Cyanamid), ‘D-D95’ (Cyanamid),
‘Nematox’ (Siapa). Mixtures [1,3-dichloropropene +] 1,2-dichloropropane.
