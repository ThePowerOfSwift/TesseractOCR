grasses, turf, pastures, rangeland, and non-crop land. Used in combinations with many

from water may occur if the dimethylammonium salt is combined with lime sulfur, heavy-
metal salts, or strongly acidic materials. Principal tradename ‘Banvel’
(dimethylammonium salt) (Sandoz), ‘Banvel SGF’ (sodium salt) (Sandoz), ‘Marksman’
(potassium salt, mixture) (Sandoz), ‘Sivel’ (dimethylammonium salt) (Siapa).
