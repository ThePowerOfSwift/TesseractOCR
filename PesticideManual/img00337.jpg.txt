History Herbicidal properties reported by H. Koopman & J. Daams (Nature [London].

1960, 186, 89). Introduced by Philips-Duphar B.V. (now Solvay Duphar B.V.).
Patents NL 572662; US 3027248 Manufacturer Cyanamid; Solvay Duphar.

APPLICATIONS . . . _ _
Mode 01’ action Systemic herbicide which acts by inhibition of cellulose synthesis of

actively growing plant tissue. Inhibits actively dividing meristems, germination of seeds
and damages rhizomes. Its selectivity can be ascribed to the fact that it is bound to the
top 5-10 cm of the soil. Uses For selective weed control of annual and many perennial
weeds in woody omamentals, fruit orchards, vineyards, bush fruit, forest plantations,
public green areas at dosages between 2.7 and 5.4 kg a.i./ ha. For total weed control in
non-crop areas at dosages up to 13.5 kg a.i./ ha. Control of ﬂoating, emergent or
submerged aquatic plant growth in non-ﬂowing water at 2.7-8.1 kg/ ha, depending on
water depth. Phytotoxicity Some conifers are susceptible to dichlobenil vapour due to
their bark structure. Formulation type GR; WP. Compatibility Wettable-powder
formulation is compatible with other wettable-powder herbicides.

Principal tradename ‘Casoron’ (Solvay Duphar), ‘Barrier’ (PBI/ Gordon), ‘Silbenil’
(Siapa). Mixtures [dichlobenil +] simazine; diuron.

roots. Plant metabolism involves ring hydroxylation (at the 3-position and, to a lesser
extent. at the 4-position) of both dichlobenil and 2,6-dichlorobenzamide and subsequent]
